# Epiclock Project – Authorship and Contribution Policy

This document outlines the criteria and procedures for authorship in the Epiclock project.  
It follows recognized standards from the **International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)** and the **Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)**.

---

## 1. Authorship Criteria
An individual will be listed as an **author** if they have made substantial intellectual contributions in at least one of the following areas:

- Conception or design of the project  
- Development or refinement of the Epiclock pipeline or scripts  
- Data acquisition, preprocessing, or analysis  
- Interpretation of results and drafting or revising the manuscript  

All authors must:
1. Approve the final version of the manuscript  
2. Agree to be accountable for their contributions

---

## 2. Acknowledgements
Contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship will be recognized in the **Acknowledgements** section.  
Examples include:
- Providing feedback or informal consultation  
- Editing without major content contribution  
- Supplying resources or data without direct involvement in analysis or writing

---

## 3. Adding Collaborators Post-Preprint
If new collaborators join **after** the initial preprint submission:
- They can be added as authors in updated versions of the preprint and in journal submissions, provided they meet authorship criteria.
- All existing authors must agree to the addition.
- Authorship changes will be documented in the project’s contribution log.

---

## 4. Contribution Tracking
We maintain a **shared contribution log** (e.g., Google Doc or GitHub issue) recording specific contributions of each author and contributor.  
This log will be referenced during:
- Manuscript preparation
- Grant applications
- Public project updates

---

## 5. Dispute Resolution
If there are disagreements over authorship or contributions:
- The **Project Lead** (currently the corresponding author) will mediate discussion among collaborators.
- If unresolved, we will follow **Northeastern University’s authorship dispute guidelines** or third-party arbitration.
